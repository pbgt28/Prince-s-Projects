Housing Market Analysis

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing housing market data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to property prices and key influencing factors. The analysis combines Python-based data analysis and Power BI visualizations to provide both analytical depth and interactive visualizations.


Problem Statement
The housing market is influenced by multiple factors such as location, property size, and amenities. Understanding these factors is essential for buyers, sellers, and analysts to make informed decisions.  
This project aims to explore and visualize housing data to identify meaningful insights and patterns.


Dataset
- Source: Kaggle  
- Type: Raw dataset  
- Preprocessing: The dataset was checked for missing and duplicate values. Since none were found, no preprocessing was required for the Power BI report.
- The dataset contains attributes related to housing prices and property features.


Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Colab for analysis
- Power BI for interactive visualizations
- GitHub for version control


Methodology
1. Loaded and explored the dataset using Python  
2. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Created visualizations to identify trends and relationships  
4. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard using the raw dataset  
5. Derived insights from both Python analysis and Power BI visuals  


Key Insights
- Housing prices show strong variation based on key property features  
- Certain attributes have a higher influence on pricing trends  
- Visualization helps in identifying outliers and market patterns clearly

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analysis and visualization tools can be effectively combined to analyze real-world datasets. The insights obtained can assist stakeholders in understanding market behavior and making data-driven decisions.
