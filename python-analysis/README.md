Project Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of a housing dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships among different factors influencing housing prices. The analysis was performed using Python on Google Colab, with the dataset preprocessed prior to analysis to ensure accuracy and reliability of insights.


Problem Statement
The real estate market is influenced by multiple factors such as location, size, and structural attributes of properties. However, understanding how these variables collectively impact housing prices can be challenging due to data complexity and inconsistencies.
This project aims to analyze a housing dataset to identify key factors affecting house prices and to gain meaningful insights through data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.


Objectives
•	To preprocess and clean the housing dataset for accurate analysis
•	To explore and understand the structure and distribution of housing data
•	To identify relationships between different housing features and prices
•	To visualize trends and correlations using effective graphical representations
•	To provide data-driven insights that can support decision-making in real estate analysis
