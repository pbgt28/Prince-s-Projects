Housing Market Analysis

Housing Market Analysis | Power BI Report

Project Overview

This project showcases an exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed using an interactive Power BI report on a real-world housing dataset sourced from Kaggle. The analysis is conducted on the raw dataset without any preprocessing, focusing purely on visual exploration and insight generation.


Objectives
	•	Analyze the distribution of housing properties based on structural features and amenities
	•	Examine the relationship between house prices and key attributes such as:
	 •	Area
	 •	Bedrooms
	 •	Bathrooms
	 •	Stories
	 •	Parking
	 •	Compare average prices across:
	 •	Furnishing status
	 •	Preferred locations
	 •	Amenity availability
	•	Identify the most influential factors affecting house prices


Business Questions Answered
	1.	Which factors have the greatest impact on house prices?
	2.	How strongly does property area influence pricing?
	3.	Which amenities significantly increase property value?
	4.	Does furnishing status justify higher prices?
	5.	How do bedrooms, bathrooms, and stories affect house prices?
	6.	Are preferred locations associated with premium pricing?
	7.	What is the dominant housing configuration in the market?
	8.	Which property features offer the highest price uplift?


Dataset Information
