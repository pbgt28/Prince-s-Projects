# Housing Price Prediction (Machine Learning)

This module extends the Housing Market Analysis project by building a Machine Learning model to predict house prices based on property features.

The goal is to understand how factors like area, bedrooms, furnishing status, and location influence property prices and to evaluate how well a regression model can estimate real market prices.

## Dataset
The same dataset used in the Python analysis and Power BI dashboard is used here to maintain consistency.

## Model Used
- Linear Regression

This model was selected because it is interpretable and suitable for understanding relationships between housing features and price.

## Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and encoding  
2. Train–test split  
3. Model training  
4. Performance evaluation using R² and error metrics  

## Output
The model predicts housing prices and helps identify which features contribute most to price variation.

This ML module complements the data analysis and visualization parts of the project.
